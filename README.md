# Multiple Timer App

A user-friendly web application that allows users to set and manage multiple timers simultaneously. The app is implemented using **JavaScript classes** for better modularity and scalability.

## Features
- Set multiple timers with custom hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Start and stop timers individually.
- Visual feedback when a timer ends, with an alarm sound.
- Delete timers when they're no longer needed.

## How It Works
1. Enter the desired time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
2. Click the **Set Timer** button to add a new timer.
3. The app displays all active timers, and each timer updates dynamically.
4. When a timer ends, it changes its appearance and plays a notification sound.
